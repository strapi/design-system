# Button

Buttons are a way to perform actions within a page. They help interact with its content via a single click. According to
their style, specific labels and icons, they help understand the most important actions to take.

**Best practices**

- A button should have a relevant and clear label.
- Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.
- If there are no primary action on a screen yet, this might be the one to look for.
- Prefer to have not more than two buttons side to side.
- To navigate to another page in your browser (use Link component instead).

### Button sizes

Main actions usually use a L button (top of a screen, footer of a modal, ...). For subsidiary action, a S button suits
more (filters, configure the view, ...).

Use the size prop to change the size of the button. You can set the value to `S` or `L`.
