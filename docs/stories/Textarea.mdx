# Textarea

TextAreas are inputs that allow users to add or edit text. They support long text formats.

**Best practices**

- Icons are always on the right side within the input (writing area) itself, never on the left side.
- Labels should be clear and concise. A few words only and without punctuation.
- Use description line as a help to give more details about the required action.
- Make sure to use the placeholder feature whenever clarification are helpful on how to use the input.
- Make sure to use to define the input as required whenever it is absolutely mandatory.
- The error message will replace the description line. The two of them cannot be on top of each other.
- The error message can be customized, make sure to write actionable information within it to help resolve an issue.
