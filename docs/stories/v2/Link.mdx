# Link

Links are used to send users to another page or an anchor. They are used for external navigation.

**Best practices**

- Use TextButton component if an action needs to be triggered within the admin panel (ex: Opening a modal ).
- Clicking on a Link most of the time opens a new tab.
- Links should always be used with an icon. If it is an external link, use the ExternalLink icon accordingly.
- Links text should be concise and describe their purpose. Users need to know exactly what they are about to do.
- Use capital letters.

## Imports

```js
import { Link } from '@strapi/design-system/v2';
```

## Usage

Links are used for external navigation. Moreover, they should be associated with an icon to indicate its external
navigation purpose.

### Base

The simplest representation of the Link component.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Base} />

### Disabled link

Depending on the permissions a user have or the status of an action, a link can be unreachable or unavailable yet.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Disabled} />

### Start & end icons

Display icons on the left or right side.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Icons} />

### Usage with other routing libraries

To use the Link component with a routing library (e.g. react-router-dom), you'll need to pass the `NavLink` component to
the `as` prop in order to replace the default HTML anchor `<a />`. You'll now be able to pass all `NavLink` props.

```jsx
import { Link } from '@strapi/design-system';
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link as={NavLink} to="/home">
  Home
</Link>;
```

#### NextJS usage

For NextJS, you'll need to wrap the `Link` with the `NextLink` component

```jsx
import { Link } from '@strapi/design-system';
import NextLink from 'next/link';

<NextLink href="/home" passHref>
  <Link>Home</Link>
</NextLink>;
```

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Link} />
