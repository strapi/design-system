# DateTimePicker

Date time pickers are a fieldset containing the DatePicker and the TimePicker. Because they're primarily controlled by a date value,
the time picker cannot be "empty" whilst a date is selected, instead it's default is `00:00`. This is similar to how you can't select
a time without a date (which defaults to today). If you don't want either of them, look at using their respective components instead.

## Usage

```js
import { DateTimePicker } from '@strapi/design-system/DateTimePicker';
```

### Basic Usage

<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.Base} />

### Controlled

The DateTimePicker can be a controlled component by passing a `value` prop and an `onChange` callback, this also
enables you to have the ability to "clear" the inputs.

<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.Controlled} />

## Initial data

Most times it's preferrable to set the initial date/time for this component. Similar to the `DatePicker` this component expects a `Date` value.

<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.InitialData} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={DateTimePicker} />
