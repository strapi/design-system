## Overview

A set of views, known as "panels", that are displayed one at a time. The tabs typically relate to one another, but it is
not a requirement.

<ViewSource path="components/Tabs" />

<Canvas of={TabStories.Base} />

## Usage

```js
import { Tabs } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Props

### Tabs

<TypeTable of={Tabs.Root} />

### List

<TypeTable of={Tabs.List} />

### Trigger

<TypeTable of={Tabs.Trigger} />

### Content

<TypeTable of={Tabs.Content} />

## Variants

### Basic Tabs

The default set of tabs have elevation to help the active tab stand out against the others. The panels are purposedly
not styled to allow for flexibility in design.

<Canvas of={TabStories.Base} />

### Disabled

Any individual trigger can be disabled by passing the `disabled` prop directly to the targeted trigger. Alternatively,
the `Root` component accepts either a boolean (which will disable every trigger) or a string which must correlate to the
value of the trigger you want to disable.

<Canvas of={TabStories.Disabled} />

### Controlled

Tabs can be externally controlled by passing a `value` prop that correlates to the value of a `Trigger`. When you pass
`value`, you must also supply an `onValueChange` function which will recieve the value of the next trigger to be
"active". If you don't want to control these externally you can omit this entirely. A `defaultValue` prop is always
required otherwise no tabpanel will be isVisible.

<Canvas of={TabStories.Controlled} />

### Simple Variant

Tabs also have a variant option of either `regular` or `simple`. By default, they are `regular` below shows `simple`.
This is useful depending on the context in which you're displaying the component.

### Error

Similar to the `disabled` prop of the `Root` component, you can also pass a `hasError` prop, this can only be a `string`
which must correlate to the value of the trigger you want to show an error on. When the `variant` is set to `simple` the
error color preceeds the `active` color.
