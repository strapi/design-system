## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Dialog WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal).

## Patterns

### Closing after async action

A typical use of a modal in Strapi is to show a small form to the user, as such, the form should be submitted before the
modal is closed and likewise, assuming success, you'd expect the modal to close. If you wrap the `confirm` button in
`Modal.Close` it will automatically close the modal on click, not awaiting the async action.

Therefore, to manage this you should control the modal programatically to close only on success of the async action.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.CloseOnSuccess} />
