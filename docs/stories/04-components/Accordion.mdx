```

## Props

### Accordion

<ArgTypes of={Accordion.Root} />

### Item

<ArgTypes of={Accordion.Item} />

### Header

<ArgTypes of={Accordion.Header} />

<ArgTypes of={Accordion.Trigger} />

## Variants

### Basic Accordion

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Base} />

### Secondary Variant

Accordions have a secondary variant that can be used to differentiate between different types of content.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Secondary} />

### Disabled

When Disabled, the accordion will not be able to be interacted with.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Disabled} />

### Expanded

By providing a defaultValue we can set an accordion item to be expanded by default.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Expanded} />

### Size

Accordions have two sizes, `S` and `M` (small & medium).

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.SizeMedium} />

### Caret Right Aligned

By default the caret is left aligned, but it can be right aligned by setting the `caretPosition` prop on an
`Accordion.Trigger`.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.RightAlignedCaret} />

### With Icon

Optionally, an icon can be added to the left of the trigger title.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithIcon} />

### With Actions

When actions are provided, they will be displayed to the right of the trigger title, you should use `IconButton`
components for the actions ensuring they are accessible with a `label` prop. The internals of the component will handle
the visual adjustments we expect from actions.

### Group

Accordion items can be built up as a group together without any additional components.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Group} />

### With Label

Whilst accordion's can't actually have labels, you can visually give them a label by combining them with the `Field`
component.
