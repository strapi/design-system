## Overview

A dialog that interrupts the user with important content and expects a response. Typically, you would prefer the
[Modal](../?path=/docs/components-modal--docs) component to interact with users.

<ViewSource path="components/Dialog" />

<Canvas of={DialogStories.Base} />

## Usage

```js
import { Dialog } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Props

### Root

<TypeTable of={Dialog.Props} />

### Trigger

The `Trigger` component permanently has the `asChild` prop meaning it will always render the child merging the props &
behaviour of the component.

<TypeTable of={Dialog.TriggerProps} />

### Content

<TypeTable of={Dialog.ContentProps} />

### Header

<TypeTable of={Dialog.HeaderProps} />

### Body

This component is not mandatory to use, but does have inbuilt styles for the recommended padding around the content.

<TypeTable of={Dialog.BodyProps} />

### Description

If you provide something other than a `string` as the `child` of `Dialog.Body` you should use this component. Otherwise,
it's not required & we use it internally for said `child`.

<TypeTable of={Dialog.DescriptionProps} />

### Footer

<TypeTable of={Dialog.FooterProps} />

### Action

Use this to wrap the buttons that act as confirmations of the dialog. It permanently has the `asChild` prop meaning it
will always render the child merging the props & behaviour of the component.

<TypeTable of={Dialog.ActionProps} />

### Cancel

Use this to wrap the buttons that act as the cancelling of the dialog action. It permanently has the `asChild` prop
meaning it will always render the child merging the props & behaviour of the component.

<TypeTable of={Dialog.CancelProps} />

## Variants

### ReactNode as Children

Most use-cases you'd only need to provide a `string` as the `child` of `Dialog.Body`. But if you need to create a more
complex dialog then you can provide a `ReactNode` as the `child` of `Dialog.Body`. If you do this, you should use the
`Dialog.Description` component to wrap the text of your dialog content.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.Children} />

## Accessibility

[Alert and Message Dialogs WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog).
