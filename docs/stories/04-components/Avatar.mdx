## Variants

### Basic Avatar

The basic avatar is a simple image with a circular border, if the image fails to load then the fallout is shown instead
after a short delay that can be configured. The default delay is `600ms`.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.Base} />

### With Preview

Useful for when the avatar is displaying assets as opposed to a user, supplying the `preview` prop (a `boolean`) will
show the image in a tooltip when hovered. The `preview` will never show if the main asset does not load.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.WithPreview} />

### Fallback

When the image fails to load, the fallback is shown. In the example below we never provide a `src` prop, so knowing
there's no chance to even load the image, we also set `delayMs` to be `0`.

<Canvas of={AvatarStories.Fallback} />

### Group

Avatars can be grouped together, when do so, they get closer to each other, but their interactions still work.
