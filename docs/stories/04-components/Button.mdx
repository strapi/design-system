## Overview

Buttons are a way to perform actions within a page. They help interact with its content via a single click. According to
their style, specific labels and icons, they help understand the most important actions to take.

<ViewSource path="components/Button" />

## Usage

```js
import { Button } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Base} />

## Props

<TypeTable of={Button} />

## Variants

Below, you can see a grid of the possible combinations a button can have upon it, for example we have different style
variants that can denote status & intention i.e. the `danger` variant would indicate a destructive action.

There are also other props such as `disabled` and `loading` that change the button. Buttons come in three sizes, `S`,
`M` and `L`, and finally they can have an icon on the left or right side of the label.
