# Accessibility

Making content available for everyone also passes by caring deeply about making content accessible for as many people as
possible. A qualitative digital experience should have a great User Experience (UX). This doesn't only include an
appealing design and a clear copy but also the fact of being inclusive to everyone.

## An inclusive usability

Its not completely true for now, but it's an objective we're aiming for. It's important that Strapi product and plugins
are usable and useful to everyone. To be inclusive means we must consider accessibility at the core of how we design and
develop. Products and digital experiences must be accessible to everyone, including those with vision, hearing,
cognitive, or mobility impairments.

## Building experiences for everyone

Using our components is a way to improve accessibility and consistency when building products for Strapi.

## Coding standards

To help people relying on assistive technologies, like text-to-speech tools or screen reader, the components use
alternative text for assets leading to action or giving information, like links, dropdowns or call-to-actions.

## Feedback

Building accessible and inclusive experiences is a hard task, and making sure we are not unintentionally excluding users
from our product is a long road. If we've made any mistakes in this style guide, please reach out by
