# Typography

Typography is an important part of the Design System that brings consistency across experiences and platforms. Good
typography rules help present content clearly and efficiently.

Strapi Design System uses system fonts to provide the best experience on every Operating System (OS). Due to that

Moreover, each level of the Type Scale is defined by the Greek alphabet to abstract all context from each level and
developed in rem instead of px. Thus, any usecase should be covered by the scale.
