Symbols are a lot stricter, they have pre-set colors and should only have their `width` and `height` set to accomodate the design you're trying to achieve.

<Subtitle>Usage</Subtitle>

```tsx
import { SYMBOL_NAME } from '@strapi/icons/symbol';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <SYMBOL_NAME width="14rem" />;
};
```

<Subtitle>All Symbols</Subtitle>
