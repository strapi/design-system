They by default, do not have a `width` or `height` set, but the default viewBox is set to `0 0 32 32` which means they
will scale to fit the parent container whatever that may be. The default `fill` is `currentColor` meaning they will
inherit the `color` of the parent container. It's not advised to overwrite the `viewBox` property.
