# Loader

Loaders indicate some data is currently loading where content usually takes place. They help to notify users that
loading is ongoing.

**Best practices**

- Once the content appears, the loader disappears.
- If the trigger only concerns a portion of a page, the loader should be placed in that part.

## Imports

```js
import { Loader } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

Loaders shows an action has been processed. Moreover, details about what is happening should be provided even if
visually hidden.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Base} />

### Small

A loader can receive a `small` prop, which renders the component much smaller.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Small} />

## Props

<TypeTable of={Loader} />
