# SubNav

The Sub Navigation is available and displayed on predefined sections of the admin panel to access advanced options (i.e.
Content Manager, Content-types Builder and Settings). Thanks to it the users can easily navigation from an entry or a
page to another. The Sub Navigation cannot be collapsed.

**Best practices**

- It is not possible to have more than 2 navigation bars next to each others.
- Each page has its own icon taken from the iconography library.
- Do not use icons for headers.
- Use sentence case for page names and all caps for header labels.
- Each plugin should have its own new category and its own header.

## Usage

The Sub Navigation cannot be collapsed. A notification system can appear in the Sub Navigation, especially in the
Settings section for the Application page.

A Text Button component can be found at the bottom of a pages gathering in the Sub Navigation.

## Hierarchy

Related pages are gathered under specific headers within the Sub Navigation. These headers are helpful to understand the
section hierarchy. Moreover, each page gets its very own icon to make it distinctive.

## Imports

```js
import {
  SubNav,
  SubNavHeader,
  SubNavSection,
  SubNavSections,
  SubNavLink,
  SubNavLinkSection,
} from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

<Canvas of={SubNavStories.Base} />

### Usage with other routing libraries

To use the Strapi design system SubNavLink component with a routing library (e.g. react-router-dom), you'll need to pass
the react-router-dom `NavLink` component to the `as` prop in order to replace the default HTML anchor `<a />`. You'll
now be able to pass all `NavLink` props.

```jsx
import { SubNavLink } from '@strapi/design-system';
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<SubNavLink as={NavLink} to="/home">
  Home
</SubNavLink>;
```

#### NextJS usage

For NextJS, you'll need to wrap the `NavLink` with the `NextLink` component

```jsx
import { SubNavLink } from '@strapi/design-system/SubNavLink';
import NextLink from 'next/link';

<NextLink href="/home" passHref>
  <SubNavLink>Home</SubNavLink>
</NextLink>;
```
