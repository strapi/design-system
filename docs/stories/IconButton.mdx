# IconButton

Icon Buttons are a way to perform actions within a page, a table or another object. They help interact with its content
via a single click in small page portion. According to their minimal style, they help understand the most important
actions to take.

**Best practices**

- Icon Buttons do not have labels.
- A Tooltip should be displayed at hover.
- Icon Buttons can be used within a group form whenever the action are related.
- Icon Buttons can be displayed next to each others whenever the actions are distinct.
- In Table component, avoid using a border.
- The icon chosen to represent the action should be perfectly explicit.
