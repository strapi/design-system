# TimePicker

A `TimePicker` is used to select a specific time. The input is modelled around the `Combobox` ARIA pattern with a `listbox`
option menu that can be navigated with your keyboard. The returned value is a `string` _not_ a `Date`.

## Usage

```js
import { TimePicker } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

### Basic Usage

By default, the TimePicker is uncontrolled & has "steps" of 15 minute intervals.

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.Base} />

### Controlled

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.Controlled} />

### Changing the option steps

The pre-determined list of options for the Time Picker can be modified by changing the `step` parameter.

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.Steps} />

### Input size

As with most inputs, we offer the ability to change the `size`.

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.Sizing} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={TimePicker} />
