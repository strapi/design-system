# Tag

Tags are used to give a quick information about a performed action. Tags can be added or removed from a page or another
component. They are also used as a filter.

**Best practices**

- Tags text should be concise and easily scannable.
- Tags text should be explicit and indicate its purpose.
- Tags should be very close to or within the performed action.
- Use Badge component if the information given is not related to a performed action.

## Imports

```js
import { Tag } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

Tags are related to a performed action. They should be very close by the action's trigger. Moreover, a tag can be added
or removed from that place. They cannot exist on their own.

<Canvas of={TagStories.Base} />

### Disabled Tag

<Canvas of={TagStories.Disabled} />

### Filter Tag

Tag can also be used as a filter with action to remove the filter

<Canvas of={TagStories.Filter} />

## Props

The Tag component wraps all its children in the
(Box)\[https://design-system-git-main-strapijs.vercel.app/?path=/docs/design-system-technical-components-box--base]
component, so you can pass all Box props to change its style.
