## What are Primitives?

Primitives in the Strapi Design System are **low-level, accessible UI components** that serve as building blocks for more complex interface elements. These components provide essential functionality and behavioral patterns while maintaining maximum flexibility for customization.

## Key Characteristics

### Built on Radix UI
Our primitives are forked and extended from [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) primitives, ensuring:
- **Accessibility by default** - Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA compliance
- **Unstyled foundations** - Behavior without imposed visual design
- **Composable architecture** - Mix and match components to build complex interfaces

### Enhanced for Strapi
While maintaining Radix UI's core principles, our primitives add:
- **Additional functionality** - Extended features like multi-select capabilities
- **Strapi-specific optimizations** - Tailored for content management use cases
- **Consistent APIs** - Unified patterns across all primitive components

## Available Primitives

- **[Select](../?path=/docs/primitives-select--docs)** - Dropdown selection with single and multi-select support
- **[Combobox](../?path=/docs/primitives-combobox--docs)** - Searchable dropdown with filtering and custom input
- **[BaseLink](../?path=/docs/primitives-baselink--docs)** - Foundation for all link-based navigation components

## When to Use Primitives

Primitives are ideal when you need:
- **Maximum customization control** over styling and behavior
- **Complex interaction patterns** not covered by standard components
- **Building custom components** that integrate seamlessly with the design system
- **Accessibility-first solutions** with minimal overhead

## Usage Pattern

```tsx
import { Select } from '@strapi/ui-primitives';

// Primitives provide the structure and behavior
<Select.Root>
  <Select.Trigger>
    <Select.Value />
  </Select.Trigger>
  <Select.Content>
    <Select.Item value="option1">Option 1</Select.Item>
    <Select.Item value="option2">Option 2</Select.Item>
  </Select.Content>
</Select.Root>
```

Most users will prefer the higher-level components from `@strapi/design-system` which wrap these primitives with Strapi's visual design and simplified APIs.
