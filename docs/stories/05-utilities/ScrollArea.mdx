# Scroll Area

Augments native scroll functionality for custom, cross-browser styling.

<ViewSource path="utilities/ScrollArea" />

<Canvas of={ScrollAreaStories.Base} />

## Usage

The `ScrollArea` component is a wrapper around `Box`. As such, any `Box` props can be passed to `ScrollArea`. By
default, the `ScrollArea` is set to the height & width of the parent container.

```tsx
import { ScrollArea } from '@strapi/design-system';

const MyPage = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <main style={{ height: '100vh' }}>
      <ScrollArea tag="article">{children}</ScrollArea>
    </main>
  );
};
```

## Props

## Accessibility

In most cases, it's best to rely on native scrolling and work with the customization options available in CSS. When that
isn't enough, ScrollArea provides additional customizability while maintaining the browser's native scroll behavior (as
well as accessibility features, like keyboard scrolling).
