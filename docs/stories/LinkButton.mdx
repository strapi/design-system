# LinkButton

LinkButtons are a way to perform actions that links to a different page component that will stay within one page. They
help interact with its content via a single click. According to their style, specific labels and icons, they help
understand the most important actions to take.

The difference with the `Button` component will be that the action of the LinkButton redirects to a different page. The
difference with the `Link` is the style.

Best practices

- A link button should have a relevant and clear label.
- Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.
- If there are no primary action on a screen yet, this might be the one to look for.
- Prefer to have not more than two buttons side to side.
- To navigate to another page in your browser (use Link component instead).

## Imports

```js
import { LinkButton } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

The most common LinkButton component used in the interface (primary action). It can have different variants and meaning.

Use the `to` parameter to redirect using the router's routes, `href` parameter for an external url.

<Canvas of={LinkButtonStories.Base} />

### LinkButton sizes

Main actions usually use a L LinkButton (top of a screen, footer of a modal, ...). For subsidiary action, a S LinkButton
suits more (filters, configure the view, ...).

Use the size prop to change the size of the button. You can set the value to S or L.

<Canvas of={LinkButtonStories.Sizes} />

### LinkButton variants

Use the variant prop to change the visual style of the LinkButton. You can set the value to default, secondary,
tertiary, success, danger, success-light, or danger-light.

<Canvas of={LinkButtonStories.Variants} />

### LinkButton with icon

A LinkButton can be associated with an icon to give more impact. You can add start and end icons to the Button component
using the startIcon and endIcon props respectively.

<Canvas of={LinkButtonStories.Icons} />

### LinkButton disabled

For all actions that cannot be performed yet, you can use the disabled state.

<Canvas of={LinkButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Usage with other routing libraries

To use the LinkButton component with a routing library (e.g. react-router-dom), you'll need to pass the `NavLink`
component to the `as` prop in order to replace the default HTML anchor `<a />`. You'll now be able to pass all `NavLink`
props.

```jsx
import { LinkButton } from '@strapi/design-system';
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<LinkButton as={NavLink} to="/home">
  Home
</LinkButton>;
```

#### NextJS usage

For NextJS, you'll need to wrap the `LinkButton` with the `NextLink` component

```jsx
import { LinkButton } from '@strapi/design-system';
import NextLink from 'next/link';

<NextLink href="/home" passHref>
  <LinkButton>Home</LinkButton>
</NextLink>;
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={LinkButton} />
