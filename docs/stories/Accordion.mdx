# Accordion

Accordions are collapsable blocks that vertically hide a stack of content. Clicking on the block reveals the associated
content.

**Best practices**

- Use accordion when you need big and/or related chunks of content to be organized in a same place.
- Use accordion for lower priority information.
- Use to shorten pages and increase readability.
- The chevron icon pointing down indicates a collapsed state and pointing up indicates an expanded state.
- Hover and active states should be used anytime it's possible.
- Content should not scroll within an accordion.
- Use chevron icon on the left side if call-to-actions are available on the right side.
