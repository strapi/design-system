# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a list of hierarchical links that inform users about their possible navigation path upwards.

**Best practices**

- Use breadcrumbs whenever a long path to achieve an action is required.
- Use breadcrumbs in modal's headers.
- Using breadcrumbs in a page or a form is _not_ a consistent experience.

## Imports

```js
import { Breadcrumbs, Crumb, CrumbLink, CrumbSimpleMenu, MenuItem } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

Breadcrumbs with CrumbLink are a list of link to help navigation.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Base} />

## Usage

Breadcrumbs with CrumbSimpleMenu displays a list of potential options or actions via a Popover component.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.WithMenu} />

## Without navigation

Breadcrumbs with Crumb are visual information only and cannot be navigated. They are mostly part of modals' headers.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.WithoutNagivation} />

## Single link

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.SingleLink} />

### Usage with other routing libraries

To use this component with a routing library (e.g. react-router-dom), you'll need to pass the library's specific `Link`
component to the `tag` prop in order to replace the default html tag the component has. You'll now be able to pass all
the props associated to that component.

```jsx
import { Breadcrumbs, CrumbLink } from '@strapi/design-system';
import { NavLink } from 'my-routing-library';

<Breadcrumbs label="Folder navigatation" tag="nav">
  <CrumbLink tag={NavLink} to="/">
    Media Library
  </CrumbLink>
</Breadcrumbs>;
```

## Props

<TypeTable of={Breadcrumbs} />
