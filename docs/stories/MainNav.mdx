# MainNav

<DeprecationNotice href="/?path=/docs/design-system-components-v2-mainnav--base">the V2 version</DeprecationNotice>

The Main Navigation is consistenly available and displayed on all the different pages of the admin panel to access the
different main sections. Thanks to it the users can easily navigation from a section to another. The Main Navigation can
be whether collapsed or extended depending on the user's choice.

**Best practices**

- It is not possible to have more than 2 navigation bars next to each others.
- Each section has its own icon and is associated with a Tooltip.
- Do not use icons for headers
- Use sentence case for section names and all caps for header labels.
- Logo asset on the top-left of the Main Navigation can be customized.

## Imports

```js
import { MainNav, NavSection, NavSections, NavCondense, NavBrand, NavUser, NavLink } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

The Main Navigation can be whether collapsed or extended depending on the user's choice with the Arrow icon at the
bottom.

The user profile can be accessed by clicking on the user name at the bottom of the Main Navigation, as much as the
possibility to log out the admin panel.

According to permissions, certain sections of the Main Navigation might not be visible nor accessible by specific users.

## Hierarchy

Related sections are gathered under specific headers within the Main Navigation. These headers are helpful to understand
the global product hierarchy.

Exception made for core plugins (i.e. Content Manager, Content-types Builder, Media Library) but a plugin should not
take place in the Main Navigation. The Main Navigation remains are concise as possible to quickly reach the most
important actions.

### MainNav

<Canvas of={MainNavStories.Base} />

<Canvas of={MainNavStories.Notifications} />

### Usage with other routing libraries

To use the Strapi design system NavLink/NavBrand component with a routing library (e.g. react-router-dom), you'll need
to pass the react-router-dom `NavLink` component to the `as` prop in order to replace the default HTML anchor `<a />`.
You'll now be able to pass all the react-router-dom `NavLink` props.

```jsx
import { NavLink } from '@strapi/design-system';
import { NavLink as RouterNavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<NavLink as={RouterNavLink} to="/home">
  Home
</NavLink>;
```

#### (⚠️ Only for Strapi Design System v1.0.0) NextJS usage

For NextJS, you'll need to wrap the `NavLink` with the `NextLink` component

```jsx
import { NavLink } from '@strapi/design-system';
import NextLink from 'next/link';

<NextLink href="/home" passHref>
  <NavLink>Home</NavLink>
</NextLink>;
```

## Props

<ArgsTable of={MainNav} />
