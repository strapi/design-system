# EmptyStateLayout

EmptyStates are a pattern used to indicate a page or a table is empty.

**Best practices**

- Use everytime a page or a table is empty.
- Use the most appropriate illustration for the usecase. If related to permissions, choose the eye one.
- Use the button to help redirecting the user to a more relevant place.

## Imports

```js
import { EmptyStateLayout } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

A page or a table might be empty for different reasons: no entries have been created yet, a user doesn't have the
permission to access something, something went wrong, ...

### EmptyStateLayout with action

EmptyStates can be coupled with a button to help redirecting the user to a more relevant place.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateLayoutStories.Base} />

### EmptyStateLayout without action

If no need to redirect the user to a more relevant place or if the context does not suit for that type of action, an
EmptyState without any particular action can be added.

<Canvas of={EmptyStateLayoutStories.WithoutAction} />

### EmptyStateLayout with longer text

<Canvas of={EmptyStateLayoutStories.WithLargeText} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={EmptyStateLayout} />
