## Overview

Checkboxes allow users to choose one or multiple values from a range of options. Use the
[Radio](../?path=/docs/inputs-radio--docs) button component if the user should select only one value.

<ViewSource path="components/Checkbox" />

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Base} />

## Usage

```js
import { Checkbox } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Props

<Controls />

## Variants

### Basic checkbox

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Base} />

### Indeterminate

The `checked` prop can be set to either a `boolean` value denoting checked or unchecked, or to `'indeterminate'`. This
is useful when the checkbox is parent of a checkbox group and some, but not all, of the children checkboxes are checked.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Indeterminate} />

### Disabled

Checkboxes may not be available to select yet. This state can be related to a lack of permission or a need to pursue
another action first.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Disabled} />

### Without Label

Some instances, such as being used in a table, you may want to have a checkbox without the visual label. If this is the
case, you should instead supply the `aria-label` prop so it is still accessible.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.WithoutLabel} />

### With Name & Value

If using in a typical `form` element, you can provide a `name` and `value` prop that will be added to the `FormData` on
submission. The story below fires a unique action `onSubmit` demonstrating this. However, if you're not using it within
a `form`, you can omit this.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.WithNameAndValue} />

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [tri-state Checkbox WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/checkbox/).
