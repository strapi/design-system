## Overview

A `TimePicker` is used to select a specific time. The input is modelled around the
[`Combobox`](../?path=/docs/inputs-combobox--docs) ARIA pattern with a `listbox` option menu that can be navigated with
your keyboard. The returned value is a `string` _not_ a `Date`.

## Usage

import { TimePicker } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

<Canvas of={TimePickerStories.Base} />

## Props

<TypeTable of={TimePicker} />

## Variants

### Basic Usage

By default, the TimePicker is uncontrolled & has "steps" of 15 minute intervals.

### Disabled

### Size

There are two options for sizes, `"S"` or `"M"`, the default is `"M"`.

### Changing the option steps

The pre-determined list of options for the Time Picker can be modified by changing the `step` parameter.

### TimePicker field

TimePicker wrapped with [`Field`](../?path=/docs/components-field--docs) component to create a powerful complete form
input
