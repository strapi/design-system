## Overview

An input field designed to not only offer users the ability to type the value they want, but also display a panel of
suggestions which filter & autocomplete as the user types for a more fluid experience. This shouldn't be confused with
the [`Select`](../?path=/docs/inputs-select--docs) component!

## Usage

```js
import { Combobox, ComboboxOption, CreatableCombobox } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Props

### Combobox

<TypeTable of={Combobox} />

### ComboboxOption

<TypeTable of={ComboboxOption} />

## Variants

### Basic Combobox

By default, the combobox is uncontrolled & uses both inline and list autocomplete, that is where as the user types
suggestions (based on the order of the options) are shown in the input field whilst the list gradually gets filtered.

### Disabled

Combobox can possibly not be available to select yet. This state can be related to a lack of permissions or a need to
pursue another action first.

### Async data

In some situations it might not be optimal to load all the data at once. In this case, you can use the `loading` prop to
load more data when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.

NOTE! You also need to supply an `onLoadMore` callback as well as defining if `hasMoreItems` is true to show the
spinner. In future iterations, we plan to omit the `hasMoreItems` prop.

### Creating new options

If you want to allow users to create new options, you can use the `CreatableCombobox` component. This is just a wrapper
around the `Combobox` component that pre-flags the `creatable` prop as `true`. You should still pass an `onCreateOption`
callback to handle the creation of the new option.

### Autocomplete settings

By default, the combobox uses both inline and list autocomplete, however you can change this behaviour to only be
`list (filter: startswith)`, `list (filter: contains)` or `none`. If you set the autocomplete mode to `none`, the first
matching option will be visually focussed

### Combobox field

Wrap the input in the necessary [`Field`](../?path=/docs/components-field--docs) component to create a powerful complete
form input
