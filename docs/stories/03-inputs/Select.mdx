## Overview

Select components are used for collecting user provided information from a list of options. They can be configured to
allow single or multiple selections.

<ViewSource path="components/Select" />

## Usage

```js
import {
  SingleSelect,
  SingleSelectOption,
  MultiSelect,
  MultiSelectOption,
  MultiSelectNested,
} from '@strapi/design-system';
```

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Base} />

## Props

### SingleSelect

<ArgTypes of={SingleSelect} />

### SingleSelectOption

<ArgTypes of={SingleSelectOption} />

### MultiSelect

<ArgTypes of={MultiSelect} />

### MultiSelectOption

<ArgTypes of={MultiSelectOption} />

### MultiSelectNested

<ArgTypes of={MultiSelectNested} />

### Basic usage

The most common usage would be the `SingleSelect` which allows a user to only select one option from a list. The list
has built in typeahead meaning pressing the letter `K` will highlight the word "Kiwi" in the example below.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Base} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Disabled} />

### Controlled

All the select variants can be a controlled component by passing a `value` prop and an `onChange` callback, this also
enables you to have the ability to "clear" the input.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Controlled} />

### Multiple select

It's possible to select multiple options by using the `MultiSelect` component instead of the `SingleSelect`. As such,
you should should look to use the `MultiSelectOption` as it's visually distinct from the `SingleSelectOption`.

By default, no transformations are made to the rendered value, but you can edit this by passing a `customizeContent`
prop, which will be called with the selected values and should return a string e.g:

```js
const customizeContent = (values: string[]) => `${values.length} are currently selected`;
```

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Multiple} />

### Multiple select with tags

Instead of passing a `customizeContent` prop, you can pass the `withTags` prop which will render the selected values as
tags instead.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.MultipleWithTags} />
