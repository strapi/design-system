# Combobox

An input field designed to not only offer users the ability to type the value they want,
but also display a panel of suggestions which filter & autocomplete as the user types for a
more fluid experience. This shouldn't be confused with the [`Select`](/docs/design-system-components-select--basic)
component!

## Usage

```js
import { Combobox, ComboboxOption, CreatableCombobox } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

### Basic Usage

By default, the combobox is uncontrolled & uses both inline and list autocomplete, that is where as the user types suggestions
(based on the order of the options) are shown in the input field whilst the list gradually gets filtered.

### Controlled

The combobox can be a controlled component by passing a `value` prop and an `onChange` callback, this also
enables you to have the ability to "clear" the input.

### Async data

In some situations it might not be optimal to load all the data at once. In this case,
you can use the `loading` prop to load more data when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.

NOTE! You also need to supply an `onLoadMore` callback as well as defining if `hasMoreItems`
is true to show the spinner. In future iterations, we plan to omit the `hasMoreItems` prop.

### Creating new options

If you want to allow users to create new options, you can use the `CreatableCombobox` component. This is
just a wrapper around the `Combobox` component that pre-flags the `creatable` prop as `true`. You should
still pass an `onCreateOption` callback to handle the creation of the new option.

### Autocomplete settings

By default, the combobox uses both inline and list autocomplete, however you can change this behaviour
to only be `list` or `none`. If you set the autocomplete mode to `none`, the first matching option will
be visually focussed
