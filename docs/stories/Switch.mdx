# Switch

Switches are used to change between enabled and disabled states. It is a binary choice.

**Best practices**

- Make sure to add state labels when using a Switch component. For inclusion matters, colors are mandatory but not
  enough to indicate a change of state.
- The state labels should only have a single word and be clear.
- A change of state should also be visible by the circle position.
- One tap should be enough to change the state.
- When in a form, prefer the usage of a Toggle component.
