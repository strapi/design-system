Accordions have two sizes, `S` and `M` (small & medium).

### Caret Right Aligned

By default the caret is left aligned, but it can be right aligned by setting the `caretPosition` prop on an
`Accordion.Trigger`.

### With Icon

Optionally, an icon can be added to the left of the trigger title.

### With Actions

When actions are provided, they will be displayed to the right of the trigger title, you should use `IconButton`
components for the actions ensuring they are accessible with a `label` prop. The internals of the component will handle
the visual adjustments we expect from actions.

Accordion items can be built up as a group together without any additional components.

### With Label

Whilst accordion's can't actually have labels, you can visually give them a label by combining them with the `Field`
component.
