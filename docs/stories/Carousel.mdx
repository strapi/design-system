# CarouselInput

Carousels are slideshow components for navigating through a set of assets.

**Best practices**

- Carousels should be mostly used in forms.
- Carousels can also be used to display only one asset.
- The end of a CarouselInput label should indicate the amount of included assets.
- A set of actions is possible via Icon Buttons within a CarouselInput.
- Carousels should at least give the possibility to remove an asset from it.
- Carousels don't have any caption but can have a description line.

## Imports

to another. It has an infinite loop. A set of actions is possible via Icon Buttons within a CarouselInput.

<Canvas of={CarouselStories.OneSlideOnly} />

## Props

The CarouselInput component wraps all its children in the
(Box)\[https://design-system-git-main-strapijs.vercel.app/?path=/docs/design-system-technical-components-box--base]
component, so you can pass all Box props to change its style.
