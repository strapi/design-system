# DatePicker

A `DatePicker` is used to select a date. The input is modelled around the `Combobox` ARIA pattern with a `dialog`
Calendar that can be navigated via keyboard arrows

[View source](https://github.com/strapi/design-system/tree/main/packages/strapi-design-system/src/DatePicker)

## Usage

```js
import { DatePicker } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

### Basic Usage

By default, the DatePicker is uncontrolled & localised to the user's browser locale whilst the calendar's initial date is set to `today`.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Base} />

### Controlled

The DatePicker can be a controlled component by passing a `value` prop and an `onChange` callback, this also
enables you to have the ability to "clear" the input.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Controlled} />

### Min/Max date

It's also possible to cap the date range that can be selected. If you don't supply an intial date when using the
min/max date props and `today` is outside of the date range it automatically sets to the minimum date.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.MinMaxDate} />

### Enforcing a locale

If you want to enforce a locale, you can pass it as a prop. This will override the user's browser locale.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Locale} />

### Input size

As with most inputs, we offer the ability to change the `size`.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Sizing} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={DatePicker} />
