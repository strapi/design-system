# Card

Cards are used to gather a set of information that needs to stand out from the rest of the page.

**Best practices**

- Content within the Card is mostly optional. Pick up what is needed.
- Content can be added to the Card. Keep in mind that spacings are important in a Card component.
- Main text is truncated at the end of the first line.
- Prioritize content within the Card so users know exactly what are the main information.
- If Call-to-Actions are used, they should be placed at the bottom of the Card.

## Imports

```js
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardBody,
  CardCheckbox,
  CardAction,
  CardAsset,
  CardTimer,
  CardContent,
  CardBadge,
  CardTitle,
  CardSubtitle,
} from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

Cards are used to gather a set of related information.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Base} />

## Card without asset action

Cards can be used without actions by removing the `CardAction` block.

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithoutAssetAction} />

## Card with asset icon

The image asset can be replaced by an icon.

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithAssetIcon} />

## Card without asset action nor timer

The `CardTimer` can be removed as well as the `CardAction` block.

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithoutAssetActionNorTimer} />

## Card without asset

If no `CardHeader` is present, the card will display a version with the body only.

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithoutAsset} />

## Card keyboard navigable

You wrap the Card in a `KeyboardNavigable` block to ensure it can be scanned using the keyboard.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Keyboard} />

## Props

The Card, CardBody, CardHeader, and CardContent components wraps all their children in the
(Box)\[https://design-system-git-main-strapijs.vercel.app/?path=/docs/design-system-technical-components-box--base]
component, so you can pass all Box props to change their style.

<ArgsTable of={Card} />
