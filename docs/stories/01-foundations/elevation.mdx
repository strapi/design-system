# Layers

Modern UI is composed of different layers, be that modals, popovers or tooltips.

## Shadows

Shadows are used to create a sense of depth and separation between elements. They might be used to indicate evelation of
an element e.g. a Popover, or alternatively, they can indicate that UI can scroll below another element e.g. Tables.

## Z-Index

The z-index determines the stacking order of elements. Elements with a higher z-index always sit in front of elements
with a lower z-index. Our current collection of z-index values are lised below with their alias, they're currently
non-linear to support growing other common use-cases we may not have encountered yet. All are accessible via the theme
object – `theme.zIndices.<alias>`.

- `navigation` – `100`
- `overlay` – `300`
- `modal` – `310`
- `dialog` – `320`
- `popover` – `500`
- `notification` – `700`
- `tooltip` – `1000`
