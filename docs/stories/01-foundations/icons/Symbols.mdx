# Symbols

Symbols are a lot stricter, they have pre-set colors and should only have their `width` and `height` set to accomodate
the design you're trying to achieve.

## Usage

```tsx
import { SYMBOL_NAME } from '@strapi/icons/symbol';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <SYMBOL_NAME width="14rem" />;
};
```

## All Symbols

Click on a symbol to copy it's import statement.

<Controls of={SymbolsStories.All} />

<Canvas of={SymbolsStories.All} />
