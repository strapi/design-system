# Icons

They by default, do not have a `width` or `height` set, but the default viewBox is set to `0 0 32 32` which means they
will scale to fit the parent container whatever that may be. The default `fill` is `currentColor` meaning they will
inherit the `color` of the parent container. It's not advised to overwrite the `viewBox` property.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ICON_NAME } from '@strapi/icons';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <ICON_NAME fill="primary700" />;
};
```

All `SVGProps` are accepted with `fill` & `stroke` being enhanced to support either theme colors or regular string
values as expected.
