# Alert

Alerts are messages displayed over the content, at the top of the screen to give information to users. They have
multiple purposes and provide context.

**Best practices**

- The alert should be relevant to the page.
- Address a single piece of information or required action.
- Content of the alert should be concise and straightforward. Provide additional information on how to resolve the issue
  if needed.
- Alerts should be used thoughtfully and occasionally not to overwhelmed the users.
- Should not be used for marketing purposes.

## Imports

```js
import { Alert } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

The most common button component used in the interface. Alerts have a title, a description, and two sizes. This default
one is aimed to give a small piece of text.

### Alert variants

Use the variant prop to change the visual style of the Button. You can set the value to `default`, `success`,
`danger` or `warning`.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.Variants} />

| State               | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default/Information | Use a default alert for an informational purpose. Examples: Latest update, a specific mode, ...                       |
| Success             | Use a success alert to indicate a successful action. Examples: Content has been saved, the locale has been added, ... |
| Danger              | Examples: Content has been saved, the locale has been added, ...                                                      |
| Warning             | Examples: A condition has occured that the user needs to be warned about, ...                                         |

### Alert with action

Alerts can contain an action. Via a Link component, they mostly encourage the user to be redirected to another page with
more information. The wording of the action should be clear and concise.

<Canvas of={AlertStories.WithAction} />

## Accessibility

- Alerts use a combination of icons and colors to show their purpose and level of importance.
- This is a visual component which does not implement toasted notification nor a live region.

## Props

The Alert component wraps all its children in the
(Box)\[https://design-system-git-main-strapijs.vercel.app/?path=/docs/design-system-technical-components-box--base]
component, so you can pass all Box props to change its style.
