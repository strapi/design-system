# Breaking Changes Migration guide

## What is this?

This is a living document of all the breaking changes in v2 of the design system. If you've added a breaking change, you'll be expected to update this document accordingly.

## Changelog

### Remove direct imports

Users can no longer `import { Combobox } from '@strapi/design-system/Combobox'`, instead they should import _all_ things from the root of the project.

### Published types

`@strapi/design-system` now comes with typescript definitions. This means you can remove any overrides you may have. They've been tested against the CMS, if you feel there are mistakes, please open a PR to fix them.

### Change font-size on html,body to 62.5%

The base font-size for the app is now 10px, so 1rem = 10px. This means that users should stop dividing their px values by 16 and instead divide by 10. This will make it easier to convert px to rem.

### Removed deprecated components

The following components have been replaced with their V2 counterpart:

- `Breadcrumbs`
- `Link`
- `LinkButton`
- `MainNav`
- `Pagination`
- `SimpleMenu`
- `SubNav`

The following components have been removed:

#### `Select` / `Option` / `OptGroup` / `SelectList`

These comoponents were deprecated previously. It is recommended to use the new iteration either the `SingleSelect` or `MultiSelect` components to replace them depending on your use case.

#### `Stack`

This was just a wrapped component around `Flex`. You should use `Flex` instead.

#### `ToggleCheckbox`

This is the same component as `ToggleInput` and therefore you should use that instead.

### Icon Updates

Many of the icons have been updated visually, this will effect snapshot tests. The default size is `1.6rem` for an icon, in the Strapi design-system this equates to 16px. We have also ensured that `paths` do not have any `fill` or `stroke` properties set, this allows the icon to be styled with CSS except for specific use cases we don't expect users to encounter. The default `color` is `currentColor` which means it will inherit the color of the parent element.

## Icon has been removed

The `Icon` component has been removed. It's primary function was to allow you to apply theme colors to icons, this is now doable with the actual icon:

```ts
// before
<Icon as={Plus} color="primary700" />

// after
<Plus fill="primary700" />
```
