feat: add consistent loading state for Select and Combobox components

Added `loading` prop to `SingleSelect`, `MultiSelect`, and enhanced `Combobox` to display a loading spinner on the trigger, replacing the dropdown caret icon when loading. This provides a consistent loading state UX across all select-type components.
