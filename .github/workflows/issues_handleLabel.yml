            Hello @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }},

            Thank you for reporting this bug, however we are unable to reproduce the issue you described given the information we have on hand. Can you please create a fresh project that you are able to reproduce the issue in, provide clear steps to reproduce this issue, and either upload this fresh project to a new GitHub repo or compress it into a `.zip` and upload it on this issue?

            We would greatly appreciate your assistance with this, by working in a fresh project it will cut out any possible variables that might be unrelated.
            Please note that issues labeled with `status: can not reproduce` will be closed in 14 days if there is no activity.

            Thank you!
