All efforts to contribute are highly appreciated, we recommend you open an issue prior to spending a lot of time making

## You found a bug

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/strapi/design-system/issues) to manage our public bugs. We keep a close
eye on this so before filing a new issue, try to make sure the problem does not already exist. You can also use the
[codesandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/strapi-design-system-r1vdp) to easily show us the bug.

## Non-editable part

The design system follows the Strapi branding. We use [Specify](https://specifyapp.com/) to be able to synchronise the
design tokens with the design tools. Some parts of the codebase **can not be modified** including:

- Icons `packages/strapi-icons/assets/icons/`
- Colors `packages/strapi-design-system/src/themes/colors.js`
- Shadows `packages/strapi-design-system/src/themes/shadows.js`
