# Colors

## Color System

For light mode interfaces, we use a color system of 12 tones on our grey scale (from neutral 0 to neutral 1000) and 5 tones on all our accent colors. All these tones have a logical gap between each other, to ensure good contrast and perfect accessibility.

As for dark mode interfaces, the same color keys are used. The only difference comes from color scales that are almost reversed and with many grey tokens to provide a good reading experience.
