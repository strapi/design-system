# Accessibility

Making content available for everyone also passes by caring deeply about making content accessible for as many people as possible. A qualitative digital experience should have a  great User Experience (UX). This doesn't only include an appealing design and a clear copy but also the fact of being inclusive to everyone.

## An inclusive usability

It’s not completely true for now, but it’s an objective we’re aiming for. It’s important that Strapi product and plugins are usable and useful to everyone. <br/> <br/>
To be inclusive means we must consider accessibility at the core of how we design and develop. <br/> <br/>
Products and digital experiences must be accessible to everyone, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, or mobility impairments.

## Building experiences for everyone

Using our components is a way to improve accessibility and consistency when building products for Strapi.

## Coding standards

To help people relying on assistive technologies, like text-to-speech tools or screen reader, the components use alternative text for assets leading to action or giving information, like links, dropdowns or call-to-actions. 

## Feedback

Building accessible and inclusive experiences is a hard task, and making sure we are not unintentionally excluding users from our product is a long road. If we’ve made any mistakes in this style guide, please reach out by [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/strapi/design-system) and help us make it better.
