# Badge

Badges are used to give a quick visual indication to the users.

**Best practices**

- Badge component should be filled only with numbers or a single word max.
- Use them next to a label or a description.
- Use the active state only with a label.
- Use Tag component if the information given needs to be related to a performed action.
