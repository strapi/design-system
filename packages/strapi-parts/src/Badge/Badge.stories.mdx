# Badge

This is the doc of the `Badge` component

## Badge

Badges are used to give a quick visual indication to the users.

**Best practices**

- Badge component should be filled only with numbers or a single word.
- Only use two words if you need to describe something complex.
- Use them next to a label or a description.
- Use the active state only with a label.
- Use Tag component if the information given needs to be related to a performed action.


## Usage

Badges are used to give a quick and short scannable information to the users. They are mostly filled with numbers or a single word. 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="base">
    <Stack size={2}>
      <div>
        <Badge>Doc</Badge>
      </div>
      <div>
        <Badge>Video</Badge>
      </div>
