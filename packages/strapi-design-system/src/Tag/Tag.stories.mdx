# Tag

Tags are used to give a quick information about a performed action. Tags can be added or removed from a page or another component. They are also used as a filter.

**Best practices**
- Tags text should be concise and easily scannable.
- Tags text should be explicit and indicate its purpose.
- Tags should be very close to or within the performed action.
- Use Badge component if the information given is not related to a performed action.

## Imports

```js
import { Tag } from '@strapi/design-system/Tag';
import HelpIcon from '@strapi/icons/HelpIcon';
```


## Usage

Tags are related to a performed action. They should be very close by the action's trigger. Moreover, a tag can be added or removed from that place. They cannot exist on their own.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="base">
    <Tag icon={<HelpIcon aria-hidden={true} />}>Hello world</Tag>
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## Props

<ArgsTable of={Tag} />
