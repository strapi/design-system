# Switch

Switches are used to change between enabled and disabled states. It is a binary choice.

**Best practices**

- Make sure to add state labels when using a Switch component. For inclusion matters, colors are mandatory but not
  enough to indicate a change of state.
- The state labels should only have a single word and be clear.
- A change of state should also be visible by the circle position.
- One tap should be enough to change the state.
- When in a form, prefer the usage of a Toggle component.

## Imports

```js
import { Switch } from '@strapi/design-system';
```

## Usage

Use a switch whenever the users need to turn something on or off in a small area or content section. A switch can be
disabled.

### Activated Switch

Activated state is one of two of them available for a Switch.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="activated">
    {() => {
      const [activated, setActivated] = useState(true);
      return (
        <Switch
          label="Activate the microphone"
          selected={activated}
          onChange={() => setActivated((s) => !s)}
          visibleLabels
        />
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Deactivated Switch

Deactivated state is one of two of them available for a Switch.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="not-activated">
    {() => {
      const [activated, setActivated] = useState(false);
      return (
        <Switch
          label="Activate the microphone"
          selected={activated}
          onChange={() => setActivated((s) => !s)}
          visibleLabels
        />
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
